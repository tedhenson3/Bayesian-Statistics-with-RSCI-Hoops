# Bayesian Statistics with RSCI Hoops
This project aims to apply Bayesian statistics in the rethinking package by Richard McElreath from his book Statistical Rethinking. There are many different techniques, packages, and software that use Bayesian statistics. This analysis will focus on Bayesian regression, quadratic approximation, causal inference, and more as I continue to develop and apply my understanding of Bayesian statistics.
